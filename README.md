# Preparation for Hackathon #2 

In hackathon #2, September 3rd, you will be asked to make predictions across a time series. These are complex problems, which present with a number of difficulties.   

In order to help you prepare, we’ve set up an example of how to solve a similar problem, and the monitors will be there for you around the clock (well… within reason) on the **[Office Hours channel on slack](https://ldssa.slack.com/messages/C6T1E97JL)**. 

You should read through the examples well ahead of time, as there will be a number of new concepts. Running these examples on your machine and coming up with questions is the best way to get ready for the big challenge ahead. 

### [Notebook 1 of 3: Timeseries - exploring the data](https://github.com/LDSSA/hackathon2/blob/master/Learning%20units/Timeseries_Part1_exploring_data.ipynb) 
### [Notebook 2 of 3: Timeseries - running the first experiments](https://github.com/LDSSA/hackathon2/blob/master/Learning%20units/Timeseries_Part2_running_first_experiments.ipynb)
### [Notebook 3 of 3: Timeseries - predicting the future](https://github.com/LDSSA/hackathon2/blob/master/Learning%20units/Timeseries_Part3_predicting_the_future.ipynb) 

Bear in mind that these notebooks are simply examples of how one person would tackle these problems, rather than “ground truth”. You absolutely should use the methods and approaches that work best for you. 

PS: there are likely to be typos, and might also be some small mistakes, please point them out to **[Pedro on slack](https://ldssa.slack.com/messages/D6F67GWEN)** as you catch them.
